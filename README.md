memory-management
=================

This is a C program that makes use of data structures to implement Optimal Page Replacement algorithm. The memory required in this code is handled dynamically.

This is a prototype of Optimal Page Replacement algorithm which takes integral inputs from the user at runtime and allocates space for it.
